## Be friendly and professional.

Always be professional and try to stay on-topic, so the community remains a place that is inviting, inclusive, and comfortable for everyone.

Be aware of your tone and focus. We love positive and productive discussions, so please keep comments on the topics at hand and not on other members of the community.

## Be courteous.

We're all busy professionals, but don't mind helping where we can. Quick Gravity Forms questions (think 5 minutes or less) work best.

For anything else, support the person who's helping you by paying for their time. Especially if you're doing client work. No one wants to feel like they're being taken advantage of and doing the work your client has contracted you for. You can even use a site like Codementor for a pair session to help with custom coding or troubleshooting. Not only do you get the help you're looking for, but the other person feels rewarded as well and our community stays strong.

And if you've received help, help someone else. We are a sharing community and want everyone to feel free to use our collective resources **and** share in return.

## Gravity Forms or any other product or service support is off-topic here.

We have a **zero tolerance policy** and you will be removed if you contact a product or service representative for support.

## It's up to you to be civil.

This almost never comes up, but if it does here are the rules we follow:

* If someone tells you that something you are doing makes them uncomfortable, just stop. Don't argue with them.
* If someone is doing something that could make other people uncomfortable, help them out and tell them.
* Finally, assume that people are basically good and doing their best. If they're making someone uncomfortable, they are not doing it on purpose or out of malice.

We try and use the 'Ouch / Oops' rules in conversations. Sometimes someone may unintentionally say something that hurts, bothers, or offends you—without the offending party intending for it to.

In those cases, it's encouraged to say 'Ouch! When I (read/heard) that, I felt hurt because…'. Likewise, the unintentionally offending party is able to say 'Oops, I'm sorry—I didn't realize that. I apologize…'

## Do Not Spam.

## Stacking Conversations

Occasionally two (or more!) conversations will happen at the same time. In those cases, you're encouraged to do whatever feels right:

* Pause one of the conversations until the other concludes
* Keep talking, @NAMING the other participants, to keep the 'thread' going
* Take one of the conversations to a private group. Above all, we want you to feel _encouraged and excited_ to chat here.

### Violating these Community Standards will result in your removal from the group.
